# Markov Chains : A Monte-Carlo approach for a 2x2 Rubik's Cube

By selecting random movements a Rubik's Cube can be seen as a finite recurrent Markov Chain. 
The idea of this small project is to use Monte-Carlo simulation to infers the distribution of the moment of the first return to the initial state.
